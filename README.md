This repository was created as part of a live-coding sessions on using Git and the tidyverse for a reproducible workflow. The video of the session is available at https://youtu.be/tZ9c8xS-jzI.

The lesson is based on Software Carpentry lessons, particularly the [git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and [tidyverse](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/05-dplyr/index.html) lessons.
